## Prerequisites and Skills Required

### Prerequisites

1. **Basic understanding of programming or scripting**  
   - Familiarity with concepts such as variables, data types, and indentation will help you grasp YAML's structure and syntax.  
   - Resource: [Understanding The Concepts of Programming](https://www.w3schools.com/programming/index.php)  

2. **Knowledge of JSON or XML (optional)**  
   - While not mandatory, experience with other data serialization formats like JSON or XML will make YAML easier to understand.  
   - Resource: [JSON.org](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)  

3. **Access to a text editor and command line**  
   - You will need tools like VSCode, Sublime Text, or even Notepad++, as well as command-line access, to edit and test YAML files.  
   - Resource: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

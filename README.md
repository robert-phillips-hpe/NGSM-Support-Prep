# NGSM-Support-Prep
Set of documents to help ER staff develop the skills necessary to support NGSM

Primarily using ChatHPE to develop self study guides for technologies we believe will likely be used in NGSM.  

Keep in mind that NGSM is very much a WIP, so the topics here aren't guaranteed to be in NGSM.  

On the other hand, it won't hurt an ER person to learn what's covered in this repo.
